Fill the positions below using players from the all the playoff teams - you can use no more than 2 players from the 
same team. i.e: you can take Goff and St. Brown, but you can't have Goff, St. Brown, and Gibbs/Lions DST/Jake Bates.

Your first flex position will get you 1.5x points. Last year we had a 2x points flex position, 
but I think 1.5x makes it less important to get that position correct and hopefully diversifies the player ownership there.""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
